# Fix

Convert user feedback into structured tasks.

## Plan Directory

@rules/blueprints.md — type dir: `plan/`, e.g. `plan/<epoch>-<slug>.md`.

Use `blueprint create plan "<topic>"` to create plan files with
proper frontmatter.

## Arguments

- `<feedback-text>` — feedback to convert (may reference files,
  behaviors, or recent changes)
- (no args) — ask user for feedback

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Context (Parallel)

Run these in parallel to understand what was recently implemented:
```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD~3..HEAD
git log --oneline -5
branch=$(git branch --show-current)
```

Also resolve the review source (parallel with above):
```bash
branch_slug=$(blueprint slug "$branch")
review_file=$(blueprint find --type review --match "$branch_slug")
```
If `review_file` found, extract: `SOURCE_SLUG=$(basename "$review_file" .md)`

If user references specific files, read those files.

### 2. Analyze Feedback

Break feedback into individual findings:
- Classify each: `bug`, `task`, or `feature`
- Set priority (P0-P4):
  - P0: Critical bugs, blocking issues
  - P1: Important bugs, high-priority features
  - P2: Normal priority (default for most feedback)
  - P3: Nice-to-have improvements
  - P4: Low priority, future consideration
- Group findings by type for phase structure

### 3. Create Single Task with Phased Design

Create ONE task containing all findings:

- TaskCreate:
  - subject: "Fix: <brief-summary-of-feedback>"
  - description: "All feedback items addressed. Findings stored in task metadata design field as phased structure. Consumable by `/implement` for epic creation."
  - metadata: {type: "task", priority: 2}
- TaskUpdate(taskId, status: "in_progress")

Then structure findings as phases and store in both plan file and
task metadata:

a. Create plan file:
   ```
   file=$(blueprint create plan "Fix: <brief-summary>" --status draft)
   ```
   If review found in step 1:
   ```
   blueprint link "$file" "$SOURCE_SLUG"
   ```
   Write findings body into `$file` (append after frontmatter).
b. Store in task: TaskUpdate(taskId, metadata: {design: "<phased-findings>", plan_file: "plan/$(basename $file)"})

Design field format:
```
## Feedback Analysis

**Phase 1: Bug Fixes**
1. Fix X in file.ts:123 — description of bug
2. Fix Y in module.ts:45 — description of bug

**Phase 2: Improvements**
3. Update Z configuration — description of improvement
4. Add W feature — description of feature

Each phase groups findings by type (bugs first, then tasks,
then features). Skip empty phases.
```

**Phase grouping rules:**
- Phase 1: Bugs (highest priority first)
- Phase 2: Tasks / improvements
- Phase 3: Features / new functionality
- Skip phases with no findings
- Each item: actionable title with file:line when available

### 4. Report

#### Commit-on-Write

Fires after every blueprint write or move per @rules/blueprints.md.
```sh
blueprint commit plan <slug>
```
If `blueprint commit` exits non-zero, STOP and alert the user
with the error output.

Output format:
```
## Fix Task: #<id>

**Findings**: N items (X bugs, Y tasks, Z features)

**Plan**: `~/workspace/blueprints/<project>/plan/<epoch>-<slug>.md` — review/edit in
`$EDITOR` before `/implement`.

**Next**: `/implement` to create tasks, or edit the plan file first.
```

## Style Rules

- Keep concise — bullet points, not prose
- No emoji
- All findings in one task — grouped by type in design phases
- Use specific file paths and line numbers when available
- Classify accurately (bug vs task vs feature matters for grouping)
- Default to P2 unless feedback indicates urgency
