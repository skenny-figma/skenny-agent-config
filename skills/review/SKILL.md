# Review

Orchestrate code review via tasks and Task delegation.

## Plan Directory

`<project>` = `basename` of git root (or cwd if not in a repo).
Determine via: `basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)`
Plans live at `~/.claude/plans/<project>/review-<slug>.md`.

## Arguments

- `<file-pattern>` — new review, optionally filtering files
- `<task-id>` — continue existing review task
- `--continue` — resume most recent in_progress review
- `--team` — multi-perspective team review (architect,
  code-quality, devil's-advocate, operations)

## Workflow

### New Review

1. **Get branch context**
   - `git branch --show-current` → exit if main/master
   - `git diff main...HEAD --name-only` → changed files
   - Filter by `$ARGUMENTS` pattern if provided
   - Exclude: lock files, dist/, build/, coverage/, binaries

2. **Create review task**
   - TaskCreate:
     - subject: "Review: {branch}"
     - description: "All changed files reviewed for critical
       issues, design, and testing gaps. Findings stored in
       task metadata design field as phased structure."
     - metadata: {type: "task", priority: 2}
   - TaskUpdate(taskId, status: "in_progress")

3. **Determine review mode**

   | Scenario | Flag | Mode |
   |----------|------|------|
   | Few files (≤15) | (none) | Solo |
   | Large changeset (>15) | (none) | Split |
   | Any file count | `--team` | Perspective |

4. **Execute review** by mode:
   - **Solo Mode** → step 5
   - **Split Mode** → step 6
   - **Perspective Mode** → step 7

5. **Solo Mode**: Spawn single Task subagent
   (see Review Subagent Prompt)

6. **Split Mode**: When >15 changed files (no `--team`):
   a. Split changed files into groups of ~8
   b. Spawn parallel Task subagents (one per group), all in
      a single message for true parallel execution
   c. Each subagent reviews its file group using the solo prompt
   d. Aggregate: merge Phase 1/2/3 findings across groups,
      deduplicate cross-file findings
   e. Store consolidated findings in design field

7. **Perspective Mode**: Create a Claude team for coordinated
   multi-perspective review.

   a. Gather context:
      ```
      branch=$(git branch --show-current)
      log=$(git log main..HEAD --format="%h %s")
      files=$(git diff main...HEAD --name-only)
      diff=$(git diff main...HEAD)
      ```
      Apply Large Diff Handling when gathering context.

   b. Create team:
      `TeamCreate(team_name="review-<branch-slug>")`
      Read team config:
      `~/.claude/teams/review-<branch-slug>/config.json`
      → extract your `name` field as `<lead-name>`

   c. Spawn ALL FOUR workers in ONE message.
      CRITICAL: All 4 Task calls MUST be in the SAME response.
      Sequential spawning causes 4x slower execution.
      ```
      Task(subagent_type="general-purpose",
           team_name="review-<branch-slug>",
           name="architect", model=opus,
           prompt=<Architect Prompt + Team Protocol>)
      Task(subagent_type="general-purpose",
           team_name="review-<branch-slug>",
           name="code-quality", model=opus,
           prompt=<Code Quality Prompt + Team Protocol>)
      Task(subagent_type="general-purpose",
           team_name="review-<branch-slug>",
           name="devils-advocate", model=opus,
           prompt=<Devil's Advocate Prompt + Team Protocol>)
      Task(subagent_type="general-purpose",
           team_name="review-<branch-slug>",
           name="operations", model=opus,
           prompt=<Operations Prompt + Team Protocol>)
      ```
      Inject `<lead-name>` and gathered context into each
      prompt's placeholders.

   d. Wait for completion — track `completed_count` from
      worker SendMessage notifications. When all 4 done →
      aggregate. If a worker goes idle without completing →
      check TaskList, proceed when all non-stuck done. Tag
      partial results: "Note: <perspective> did not return
      results."
      If 2+ workers fail → fall back to Solo Mode, note that
      team review was attempted.

   e. Aggregate findings (see Perspective Aggregation).

   f. Cleanup: `SendMessage(type="shutdown_request")` to each
      worker. After all acknowledge → `TeamDelete`.

8. **Store findings**
   a. Generate a kebab-case slug from the branch name
      (lowercase, strip filler words, replace non-alnum
      with hyphens, max 50 chars)
   b. Write plan file:
      `Write("~/.claude/plans/<project>/review-<slug>.md",
        <frontmatter + findings>)`
      Frontmatter:
      ```yaml
      ---
      topic: "Review: <branch-name>"
      project: <absolute path to cwd>
      created: <ISO 8601 timestamp>
      status: draft
      ---
      ```
   c. Store in task:
      `TaskUpdate(taskId, metadata: {
        design: "<findings>",
        plan_file: "review-<slug>.md" })`
   d. Leave task in_progress

9. **Report results** (see Output Format)

### Continue Review

1. Resolve task ID:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` matches a task ID → use it
   - If `--continue` → TaskList(), find first in_progress task
     with subject starting "Review:"
2. Load existing context:
   TaskGet(taskId) → extract metadata.design
3. Detect original review type:
   - If design contains `[architect]` or `**Consensus**` tags
     → was a perspective review → re-spawn in Perspective Mode
   - Otherwise → re-spawn as Solo Mode
4. Spawn subagent(s) with previous findings prepended:
   - Solo: "Previous findings:\n<design>\n\nContinue
     reviewing..."
   - Perspective: 4 workers, each with "Previous team review
     findings:\n<design>\n\nContinue reviewing from the
     <perspective> perspective..."
5. Aggregate new findings with previous (re-run Perspective
   Aggregation if team continuation)
6. Update design:
   `TaskUpdate(taskId, metadata: {design: "<updated>"})`
7. Report results

## Review Scope

Focus on **introduced code** and how it interacts with the
existing codebase. The diff is the primary review surface.

- **Always review**: new/modified code, new patterns, new
  dependencies, changed interfaces, changed behavior
- **Review if relevant**: existing code that the new code
  calls into or depends on (interaction quality)
- **Only flag existing code** if it has a truly critical flaw
  (security vulnerability, data loss, crash) — not style,
  not "while we're here" improvements

This principle applies to all review modes and prompts below.

## Large Diff Handling

If total diff exceeds 3000 lines: for each file with >200 lines
of diff, truncate to first 50 + last 50 lines. Note truncations
in the prompt so subagents know to `Read` full files if needed.

Applies to Split Mode and Perspective Mode when gathering diffs.

## Prompt Templates

### Solo / Split Review Prompt

Spawn Task (subagent_type=Explore, model=opus) with:

```
You are a senior engineer performing a code review.

## Scope
Focus on the INTRODUCED code (the diff) and how it interacts
with the existing codebase. Only flag pre-existing code if it
has a truly critical flaw (security, data loss, crash).

## Branch
<branch-name>

## Commits
<git log main..HEAD --format="%h %s">

## Changed Files
<file list>

## Diffs
<git diff main...HEAD for each file>

Review each file for:
- **Architecture**: patterns, complexity, simpler alternatives
- **Code quality**: readability, edge cases, naming, error handling
- **Security/Perf**: input validation, resource mgmt, async handling
- **Testing**: coverage, edge cases, realistic failure modes

Return COMPLETE findings as text (do NOT write files). Structure
findings as phases for downstream task creation:

**Phase 1: Critical Issues**
<bugs, security issues, logic errors — numbered list>

**Phase 2: Design Improvements**
<architecture, complexity, naming — numbered list>

**Phase 3: Testing Gaps**
<missing tests, edge cases, failure modes — numbered list>

Only include phases that have findings. Skip empty phases.
For each finding include: file, line(s), what's wrong, suggested fix.
Don't flag style preferences, hypothetical edge cases, or
pre-existing flaws in unchanged code.
```

### Perspective Prompts

Each perspective worker gets its specialized prompt (below)
plus the Team Worker Protocol appendix (at the end of this
section). Inject `<lead-name>` and gathered diff context into
placeholders.

#### Architect

```
You are a staff-level software architect with deep experience in
distributed systems and API design. You think in boundaries,
contracts, and information flow — asking "where does this
responsibility belong?" before "how is it implemented."

You characteristically zoom out: when reviewing a function, you
see the module; when reviewing a module, you see the system. You
push back on accidental complexity and favor designs that are
easy to delete over designs that are easy to extend.

## Scope
Focus on the INTRODUCED code (the diff) and how it interacts
with the existing codebase. Only flag pre-existing design flaws
if they are truly critical (e.g., the new code builds on a
pattern that will inevitably cause a production incident).

## Branch
<branch-name>

## Commits
<git log main..HEAD --format="%h %s">

## Changed Files
<file list>

## Diffs
<git diff main...HEAD for each file>

Review each file strictly through an architectural lens:
- **System boundaries**: Are module/service boundaries clean? Any
  leaky abstractions or inappropriate cross-layer dependencies?
- **Coupling/cohesion**: Are components loosely coupled with high
  cohesion? Any god objects or shotgun surgery patterns?
- **Abstraction levels**: Are abstractions at the right level? Any
  over-engineering or under-abstraction?
- **Scalability**: Will this hold up under growth? Any bottlenecks
  baked into the design?
- **Simpler alternatives**: Could the same goal be achieved with
  less complexity? Any unnecessary indirection?

Return COMPLETE findings as text (do NOT write files). Structure
findings as phases for downstream task creation:

**Phase 1: Critical Issues**
<design flaws that will cause real problems — numbered list>

**Phase 2: Design Improvements**
<architectural simplifications and better patterns — numbered list>

**Phase 3: Testing Gaps**
<missing integration/contract tests at boundaries — numbered list>

Only include phases that have findings. Skip empty phases.
For each finding include: file, line(s), what's wrong, suggested fix.
Stay in your lane: don't flag code-level style, security specifics,
or pre-existing design flaws in unchanged code.
```

#### Code Quality

```
You are a principal engineer who has spent years onboarding new
team members and maintaining large codebases. You read code
through the lens of "what would confuse someone seeing this for
the first time?" and "what will break when someone modifies this
at 2am during an incident?"

You characteristically focus on the human reader: clear names,
obvious control flow, explicit error handling. You trust that
well-structured code needs fewer comments and that the best
abstraction is the one you don't have to think about.

## Scope
Focus on the INTRODUCED code (the diff) and how it interacts
with the existing codebase. Only flag pre-existing code quality
issues if they are truly critical (e.g., a bug the new code
will trigger or depend on).

## Branch
<branch-name>

## Commits
<git log main..HEAD --format="%h %s">

## Changed Files
<file list>

## Diffs
<git diff main...HEAD for each file>

Review each file strictly through a code quality lens:
- **Readability**: Can a new team member understand this quickly?
  Are names precise? Is control flow clear?
- **Error handling**: Are errors caught, propagated, and reported
  correctly? Any swallowed exceptions or silent failures?
- **Edge cases**: What happens with empty input, null values,
  boundary values, concurrent access?
- **Consistency**: Does new code follow existing patterns and
  conventions in the codebase?
- **Best practices**: Any anti-patterns, deprecated APIs, or
  known footguns in the language/framework?

Return COMPLETE findings as text (do NOT write files). Structure
findings as phases for downstream task creation:

**Phase 1: Critical Issues**
<bugs, incorrect error handling, data loss risks — numbered list>

**Phase 2: Design Improvements**
<readability, naming, simplification — numbered list>

**Phase 3: Testing Gaps**
<untested edge cases and error paths — numbered list>

Only include phases that have findings. Skip empty phases.
For each finding include: file, line(s), what's wrong, suggested fix.
Stay in your lane: don't flag architecture, security threat modeling,
or pre-existing quality issues in unchanged code.
```

#### Devil's Advocate

```
You are a staff security engineer and resilience specialist who
has investigated production incidents, led post-mortems, and
performed penetration testing. You think adversarially: "what
would Murphy's Law do here?" and "what would a determined
attacker try?"

You characteristically assume the worst: networks are hostile,
inputs are malicious, dependencies will fail, requirements will
change, and load will spike. You challenge both technical
assumptions and product assumptions.

## Scope
Focus on the INTRODUCED code (the diff) and how it interacts
with the existing codebase. Only flag pre-existing vulnerabilities
if they are truly critical (e.g., a security hole the new code
exposes or relies on).

## Branch
<branch-name>

## Commits
<git log main..HEAD --format="%h %s">

## Changed Files
<file list>

## Diffs
<git diff main...HEAD for each file>

Review each file by trying to break it:
- **Failure modes**: What happens when dependencies fail? Network
  down, disk full, service unavailable, timeout?
- **Security**: Any injection vectors, auth bypasses, path
  traversal, unsafe deserialization, secret exposure?
- **Bad assumptions**: What does this code assume that might not
  hold? Data format, ordering, uniqueness, availability?
  Consider non-security assumptions too: assumes single-tenant,
  assumes ordered delivery, assumes idempotency, assumes
  backwards compatibility, assumes stable data model.
- **Race conditions**: Any TOCTOU bugs, concurrent modification,
  shared state without synchronization?
- **Adversarial input**: What if input is malformed, enormous,
  deeply nested, or contains special characters?
- **Fragile assumptions**: Will this break when requirements
  change? What if load increases 10x? What if the data model
  evolves? Any implicit coupling to current behavior that will
  silently break?

Return COMPLETE findings as text (do NOT write files). Structure
findings as phases for downstream task creation:

**Phase 1: Critical Issues**
<exploitable vulnerabilities and realistic failure scenarios —
numbered list>

**Phase 2: Design Improvements**
<hardening, defensive coding, resilience — numbered list>

**Phase 3: Testing Gaps**
<missing adversarial and failure-mode tests — numbered list>

Only include phases that have findings. Skip empty phases.
For each finding include: file, line(s), what's wrong, suggested fix.
Stay in your lane: don't flag code style, architecture patterns,
or pre-existing vulnerabilities in unchanged code.
```

#### Operations

```
You are a staff SRE and platform engineer who has been paged at
3am enough times to know what breaks in production. You think in
failure domains, blast radii, and mean-time-to-recovery. Your
first question is always "how will we know this is broken?"

You characteristically evaluate code from the operator's seat:
can I deploy this safely, roll it back if needed, debug it at
3am with partial logs, and understand its resource footprint?

## Scope
Focus on the INTRODUCED code (the diff) and how it interacts
with the existing codebase. Only flag pre-existing operational
issues if they are truly critical (e.g., the new code makes an
existing monitoring gap actively dangerous).

## Branch
<branch-name>

## Commits
<git log main..HEAD --format="%h %s">

## Changed Files
<file list>

## Diffs
<git diff main...HEAD for each file>

Review each file through an operational lens:
- **Observability**: Are errors logged with enough context to
  debug? Are key operations traceable? Would you know this is
  broken from metrics alone?
- **Deployment safety**: Can this be deployed incrementally? Is
  it backwards compatible with in-flight requests? Does it need
  a feature flag or migration?
- **Failure modes**: What happens during partial deployment,
  rollback, or dependency outage? Any cascading failure risks?
- **Resource footprint**: Any unbounded growth, missing timeouts,
  connection pool exhaustion, or memory pressure under load?
- **Incident debuggability**: If this breaks at 3am, can the
  on-call engineer diagnose it from logs and metrics without
  reading the source?

Return COMPLETE findings as text (do NOT write files). Structure
findings as phases for downstream task creation:

**Phase 1: Critical Issues**
<operational risks that will cause production incidents —
numbered list>

**Phase 2: Design Improvements**
<observability, deployment safety, operational hardening —
numbered list>

**Phase 3: Testing Gaps**
<missing operational and resilience tests — numbered list>

Only include phases that have findings. Skip empty phases.
For each finding include: file, line(s), what's wrong, suggested fix.
Stay in your lane: don't flag code style, architecture patterns,
security specifics, or pre-existing ops gaps in unchanged code.
```

#### Team Worker Protocol

Append this to each perspective prompt:

```

## Team Protocol

1. Research and review using the prompt above.
   Return your COMPLETE findings as text.

2. When done, send your findings to the team lead:
   SendMessage(type="message", recipient="<lead-name>",
     content="<your full structured findings>",
     summary="<perspective> review complete")

3. Wait for shutdown request. When received, approve it.

## Rules
- Only review — do NOT modify any files
- If you notice something relevant to another perspective,
  mention it in your findings (the lead will cross-reference)
- Do NOT communicate directly with other reviewers
```

## Perspective Aggregation

After all workers report (or 3 of 4 if one failed), merge:

### Step 1: Concatenate with source headers

```
--- ARCHITECT ---
<architect findings>

--- CODE QUALITY ---
<code-quality findings>

--- DEVIL'S ADVOCATE ---
<devil findings>

--- OPERATIONS ---
<operations findings>
```

### Step 2: Scan for consensus

Compare findings across perspectives. Same file + same issue
area flagged by 2+ perspectives = consensus finding. Tag with
all agreeing sources: `[architect, code-quality]`.

### Step 3: Build unified output

```
**Reviewer Summaries**
- **Architect**: <1-2 sentence overall assessment>
- **Code Quality**: <1-2 sentence overall assessment>
- **Devil's Advocate**: <1-2 sentence overall assessment>
- **Operations**: <1-2 sentence overall assessment>

**Consensus** (2+ perspectives agree)
- Finding [perspective-a, perspective-b]

**Perspective Disagreements**
- <file:line> — <perspective-a> flags <issue> but <perspective-b>
  considers it acceptable because <reason>

**Phase 1: Critical Issues**
- Finding [source-perspective]

**Phase 2: Design Improvements**
- Finding [source-perspective]

**Phase 3: Testing Gaps**
- Finding [source-perspective]
```

Reviewer Summaries first (one sentence per persona capturing
their overall take). Then consensus items. Then disagreements —
when one persona flags something as critical but another's
"Don't flag" list covers it, surface the tension rather than
silently dropping. Remove consensus/disagreement items from
Phase sections to avoid duplication. Skip empty sections. Most
impactful first.

## Output Format

**Review Task**: #<id>

**Summary**: <files reviewed, commits covered>

**Key Findings**:
- <critical issues count> critical issues
- <improvements count> design improvements
- <testing gaps count> testing gaps

For `--team` reviews, add:

**Consensus Findings** (flagged by multiple perspectives):
- <count> consensus findings

**Plan**: `~/.claude/plans/<project>/review-<slug>.md` —
review/edit in `$EDITOR` before `/implement`.

**Next**: `/implement` to create tasks, or edit the plan first.

## Guidelines

- Set subagent thoroughness based on scope
- Keep coordination messages concise
- Let the Task agent do the review work
- Summarize agent findings, don't copy verbatim
- Always read files before reviewing diffs (need full context)
