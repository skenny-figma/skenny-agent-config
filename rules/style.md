# Coding Preferences

- Prefer simple, readable code over clever abstractions
- Avoid over-engineering - only build what's needed now
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on one thing
- Write code that's easy to delete, not easy to extend
- Delete old code completely — no deprecation shims
- No semantic prefix/suffix (OptimizedX, FastY, ClientImpl)
- No versioned names (processV2, handleNew, ClientOld)
- No migration code unless explicitly requested
